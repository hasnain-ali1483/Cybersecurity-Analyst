Networking:
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices so they can communicate, share resources, and exchange data.
In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your 
laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!

Internet:
The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself. These small networks are called 
private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks or the Internet. The first iteration 
of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence 
Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know 
it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It wasn't until this point that the Internet 
started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.
