Networking:
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices so they can communicate, share resources, and exchange data.
In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your 
laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!

Internet:
The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself. These small networks are called 
private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks or the Internet. The first iteration 
of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence 
Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know 
it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It wasn't until this point that the Internet 
started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.

 IP Address:
 An IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, 
 where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing. An IP address is a set of 
 numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the 
 network. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting, IP addresses can change from device 
 to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network. IP Addresses follow a set of standards 
 known as protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and force many devices to communicate in the same language.
 Depending on where they are will determine what type of IP address they have: a public or private IP address.
 A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst 
 other devices.

 MAC Addresses:
 Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. 
 This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a MAC (Media Access Control ) address. 
 The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) 
 split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d. The first six 
 characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.
 
 However, an interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed" in a process known as spoofing. This 
 spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address. When this occurs, it can often break 
 poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy. Take the following scenario: 
 A firewall is configured to allow any communication going to and from the MAC address of the administrator. If a device were to 
 pretend or "spoof" this MAC address, the firewall would now think that it is receiving communication from the administrator when 
 it isn't.

 Ping:
 Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools available to us. Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to 
 determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable. The time taken for 
 ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping. This measuring is done using ICMP's echo packet and then ICMP's echo 
 reply from the target device. Pings can be performed against devices on a network, such as your home network or resources like websites. 
 This tool can be easily used and comes installed on Operating Systems (OSs) such as Linux and Windows. The syntax to do a simple ping is 
 ping IP address or website URL.

LAN Topologies:
LAN Topologies are the physical connections between devices on a network. There are three main types of LAN topologies:

 Sar Topology:
 The main premise of a star topology is that devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub. 
 This topology is the most commonly found today because of its reliability and scalability - despite the cost. Any information sent to a 
 device in this topology is sent via the central device to which it connects. 

 Because more cabling and the purchase of dedicated networking equipment is required for this topology, it is more expensive than any 
 of the other topologies. However, despite the added cost, this does provide some significant advantages. For example, this topology is 
 much more scalable in nature, which means that it is very easy to add more devices as the demand for the network increases.

 Unfortunately, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network functional. This increased dependence 
 on maintenance can also make troubleshooting faults much harder. Furthermore, the star topology is still prone to failure - albeit reduced. 
 For example, if the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data. 
 Thankfully, these centralised hardware devices are often robust.

 Bus Topology:
 This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable. This type of topology is similar to the leaf 
 off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable. Because all data destined for each device 
 travels along the same cable, it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously 
 requesting data. This bottleneck also results in very difficult troubleshooting because it quickly becomes difficult to identify which 
 device is experiencing issues with data all travelling along the same route.

 However, with this said, bus topologies are one of the easier and more cost-efficient topologies to set up because of their expenses, such 
 as cabling or dedicated networking equipment used to connect these devices.

 Lastly, another disadvantage of the bus topology is that there is little redundancy in place in case of failures. This disadvantage is 
 because there is a single point of failure along the backbone cable. If this cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit 
 data along the bus.

 Ring Topology:
 The ring topology (also known as token topology) boasts some similarities. Devices such as computers are connected directly to each other 
 to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology. 
 A ring topology works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward 
 the data. Interestingly, a device will only send received data from another device in this topology if it does not have any to send itself. 
 If the device happens to have data to send, it will send its own data first before sending data from another device.

 Because there is only one direction for data to travel across this topology, it is fairly easy to troubleshoot any faults that arise. However, 
 this is a double-edged sword because it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple 
 devices first before reaching the intended device.

 Lastly, ring topologies are less prone to bottlenecks, such as within a bus topology, as large amounts of traffic are not travelling across 
 the network at any one time. The design of this topology does, however, mean that a fault such as cut cable, or broken device will result 
 in the entire networking breaking.

Switch:
Switches are dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any 
other networking-capable device using ethernet. These various devices plug into a switch's port. Switches are usually found in larger networks 
such as businesses, schools, or similar-sized networks, where there are many devices to connect to the network. Switches can connect a large 
number of devices by having ports of 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 for devices to plug into.

Switches are much more efficient than their lesser counterpart (hubs/repeaters). Switches keep track of what device is connected to which port. 
This way, when they receive a packet, instead of repeating that packet to every port like a hub would do, it just sends it to the intended target, 
thus reducing network traffic.

Both Switches and Routers can be connected to one another. The ability to do this increases the redundancy (the reliability) of a network by adding 
multiple paths for data to take. If one path goes down, another can be used. Whilst this may reduce the overall performance of a network because 
packets have to take longer to travel, there is no downtime -- a small price to pay considering the alternative.
