Networking:
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices so they can communicate, share resources, and exchange data.
In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your 
laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!

Internet:
The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself. These small networks are called 
private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks or the Internet. The first iteration 
of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence 
Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know 
it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It wasn't until this point that the Internet 
started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.

 IP Address:
 An IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, 
 where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing. An IP address is a set of 
 numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the 
 network. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting, IP addresses can change from device 
 to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network. IP Addresses follow a set of standards 
 known as protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and force many devices to communicate in the same language.
 Depending on where they are will determine what type of IP address they have: a public or private IP address.
 A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst 
 other devices.

 MAC Addresses:
 Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. 
 This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a MAC (Media Access Control ) address. 
 The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) 
 split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d. The first six 
 characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.
 
 However, an interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed" in a process known as spoofing. This 
 spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address. When this occurs, it can often break 
 poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy. Take the following scenario: 
 A firewall is configured to allow any communication going to and from the MAC address of the administrator. If a device were to 
 pretend or "spoof" this MAC address, the firewall would now think that it is receiving communication from the administrator when 
 it isn't.

 Ping:
 Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools available to us. Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to 
 determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable. The time taken for 
 ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping. This measuring is done using ICMP's echo packet and then ICMP's echo 
 reply from the target device. Pings can be performed against devices on a network, such as your home network or resources like websites. 
 This tool can be easily used and comes installed on Operating Systems (OSs) such as Linux and Windows. The syntax to do a simple ping is 
 ping IP address or website URL.

LAN Topologies:
LAN Topologies are the physical connections between devices on a network. There are three main types of LAN topologies:

 Sar Topology:
 The main premise of a star topology is that devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub. 
 This topology is the most commonly found today because of its reliability and scalability - despite the cost. Any information sent to a 
 device in this topology is sent via the central device to which it connects. 

 Because more cabling and the purchase of dedicated networking equipment is required for this topology, it is more expensive than any 
 of the other topologies. However, despite the added cost, this does provide some significant advantages. For example, this topology is 
 much more scalable in nature, which means that it is very easy to add more devices as the demand for the network increases.

 Unfortunately, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network functional. This increased dependence 
 on maintenance can also make troubleshooting faults much harder. Furthermore, the star topology is still prone to failure - albeit reduced. 
 For example, if the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data. 
 Thankfully, these centralised hardware devices are often robust.

 Bus Topology:
 This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable. This type of topology is similar to the leaf 
 off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable. Because all data destined for each device 
 travels along the same cable, it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously 
 requesting data. This bottleneck also results in very difficult troubleshooting because it quickly becomes difficult to identify which 
 device is experiencing issues with data all travelling along the same route.

 However, with this said, bus topologies are one of the easier and more cost-efficient topologies to set up because of their expenses, such 
 as cabling or dedicated networking equipment used to connect these devices.

 Lastly, another disadvantage of the bus topology is that there is little redundancy in place in case of failures. This disadvantage is 
 because there is a single point of failure along the backbone cable. If this cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit 
 data along the bus.

 Ring Topology:
 The ring topology (also known as token topology) boasts some similarities. Devices such as computers are connected directly to each other 
 to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology. 
 A ring topology works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward 
 the data. Interestingly, a device will only send received data from another device in this topology if it does not have any to send itself. 
 If the device happens to have data to send, it will send its own data first before sending data from another device.

 Because there is only one direction for data to travel across this topology, it is fairly easy to troubleshoot any faults that arise. However, 
 this is a double-edged sword because it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple 
 devices first before reaching the intended device.

 Lastly, ring topologies are less prone to bottlenecks, such as within a bus topology, as large amounts of traffic are not travelling across 
 the network at any one time. The design of this topology does, however, mean that a fault such as cut cable, or broken device will result 
 in the entire networking breaking.

Switch:
Switches are dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any 
other networking-capable device using ethernet. These various devices plug into a switch's port. Switches are usually found in larger networks 
such as businesses, schools, or similar-sized networks, where there are many devices to connect to the network. Switches can connect a large 
number of devices by having ports of 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 for devices to plug into.

Switches are much more efficient than their lesser counterpart (hubs/repeaters). Switches keep track of what device is connected to which port. 
This way, when they receive a packet, instead of repeating that packet to every port like a hub would do, it just sends it to the intended target, 
thus reducing network traffic.

Both Switches and Routers can be connected to one another. The ability to do this increases the redundancy (the reliability) of a network by adding 
multiple paths for data to take. If one path goes down, another can be used. Whilst this may reduce the overall performance of a network because 
packets have to take longer to travel, there is no downtime -- a small price to pay considering the alternative.

Router:
It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them. It does this by using routing (hence the name router!). Routing is the label 
given to the process of data travelling across networks. Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully 
delivered. Routing is useful when devices are connected by many paths

Subnetting:
Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller networks. This is done by dividing the network into multiple smaller networks. 
The smaller networks are called subnets. This is done to increase the security of a network by making it harder for hackers to access it.
Subnetting is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask.
Like an IP address is made up of four sections called octets. The same goes for a subnet mask which is also represented as a number of four 
bytes (32 bits), ranging from 0 to 255 (0-255).

Subnetting provides a range of benefits, including:
->Efficiency
->Security
->Full control

Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:
->Identify the network address
->Identify the host address
->Identify the default gateway

 Network Address:
 This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence.
 For example, a device with the IP address of 192.168.1.100 will be on the network identified by 192.168.1.0.

 Host Address:
 An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet.
 For example, a device will have the network address of 192.168.1.1

 Default Gateway:
 The default gateway address is a special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network.
 Any data that needs to go to a device that isn't on the same network (i.e. isn't on 192.168.1.0) will be sent to this device. These devices can 
 use any host address but usually use either the first or last host address in a network (.1 or .254).

ARP:
A MAC address and an IP address, the Address Resolution Protocol or ARP for short, is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to 
identify themselves on a network. Simply, ARP allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network. Each device on a 
network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices. When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a
broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device. Devices can use ARP to find the MAC address (and therefore the physical 
identifier) of a device for communication.

 Working of ARP:
 Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on, which is called a cache. In the context of ARP, this cache stores the identifiers 
 of other devices on the network.
 
 In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), ARP sends two types of messages:
 ->ARP Request
 ->ARP Reply
 When an ARP request is sent, a message is broadcasted on the network to other devices asking, "What is the mac address that owns this IP address?" 
 When the other devices receive that message, they will only respond if they own that IP address and will send an ARP reply with its MAC address. 
 The requesting device can now remember this mapping and store it in its ARP cache for future use.

DHCP:
IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP (Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol) server. When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a 
request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network. The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer). 
The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request), and then lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this 
has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).

OSI Model:
The OSI model (or Open Systems Interconnection Model) is an essential model used in networking.  This critical model provides a framework dictating 
how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data. One of the main benefits of the OSI model is that devices can have different functions 
and designs on a network while communicating with other devices. Data sent across a network that follows the uniformity of the OSI model can be 
understood by other devices.
The OSI model consists of seven layers. Each layer has a different set of responsibilities and is arranged from Layer 7 to Layer 1.
At every individual layer that data travels through, specific processes take place, and pieces of information are added to this data. This process is 
called encapsulation.

Layer 7: Application Layer
Layer 6: Presentation Layer
Layer 5: Session Layer
Layer 4: Transport Layer
Layer 3: Network Layer
Layer 2: Data Link Layer
Layer 1: Physical Layer

 ->Physical Layer: 
   This layer references the physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find. 
   Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's).

   For example, ethernet cables connecting devices.

 ->Data Link Layer: 
   The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer 
   (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint. 
   Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it.
   MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can’t be changed – although they can be spoofed. When 
   information is sent across a network, it’s actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send the information. 
   Additionally, it’s also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.

 ->Network Layer: 
   The third layer of the OSI model (network layer) is where the magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from these small 
   chunks to the larger chunk). Firstly, routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.

   Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the "optimal" path that data should take to reach a device, we should only know
   about their existence at this stage of the networking module. Briefly, these protocols include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP 
   (Routing Information Protocol). The factors that decide what route is taken is decided by the following:

   -->What path is the shortest? I.e. has the least amount of devices that the packet needs to travel across.
   -->What path is the most reliable? I.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
   -->Which path has the faster physical connection? I.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) or a fibre (considerably faster)?
   At this layer, everything is dealt with via IP addresses such as 192.168.1.100. Devices such as routers capable of delivering packets using IP 
   addresses are known as Layer 3 devices — because they are capable of working at the third layer of the OSI model.

 ->Transport Layer:
   When data is sent between devices, it follows one of two different protocols that are decided based upon several factors:

   -->TCP:
      The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) reserves a constant connection between the two devices for the amount of time it takes for the 
      data to be sent and received. Not only this, but TCP incorporates error checking into its design. Error checking is how TCP can guarantee 
      that data sent from the small chunks in the session layer (layer 5) has then been received and reassembled in the same order.
      Advantages:
      --->Guarantees the accuracy of data.
      --->Capable of synchronising two devices to prevent each other from being flooded with data.
      --->Performs a lot more processes for reliability.
      
      Disadvantages:
      --->Requires a reliable connection between the two devices. If one small chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be used.
      --->A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the receiving computer the whole time.
      --->TCP is significantly slower than UDP because more work has to be done by the devices using this protocol.
      
      TCP is used for situations such as file sharing, internet browsing or sending an email. This usage is because these services require the data to 
      be accurate and complete.
   
   -->UDP:
      User Datagram Protocol doesn't boast the many features offered by TCP, such as error checking and reliability. In fact, any data that gets sent 
      via UDP is sent to the computer whether it gets there or not. There is no synchronisation between the two devices or guarantee.
      Advantages:
      --->UDP is much faster than TCP.
      --->UDP leaves the application layer (user software) to decide if there is any control over how quickly packets are sent.
      --->UDP does not reserve a continuous connection on a device as TCP does.

      Disadvantages:
      --->UDP doesn't care if the data is received.
      --->It is quite flexible to software developers in this sense.
      ---> This means that unstable connections result in a terrible experience for the user.

      UDP is useful in situations where there are small pieces of data being sent. For example, protocols used for discovering devices (ARP and DHCP) 
      or larger files such as video streaming (where it is okay if some part of the video is pixelated. Pixels are just lost pieces of data!)

 ->Session Layer:
   Once data has been correctly translated or formatted from the presentation layer (layer 6), the session layer (layer 5) will begin to create and 
   maintain the connection to other computer for which the data is destined. When a connection is established, a session is created. Whilst this 
   connection is active, so is the session. The session layer is also responsible for closing the connection if it hasn't been used in a while or 
   if it is lost. Additionally, a session can contain "checkpoints," where if the data is lost, only the newest pieces of data are required to be 
   sent, saving bandwidth. Sessions are unique — meaning that data cannot travel over different sessions, but in fact, only across each session instead.

 ->Presentation Layer:
   This layer acts as a translator for data to and from the application layer (layer 7). The receiving computer will also understand data sent to a 
   computer in one format destined for in another format. For example, when you send an email, the other user may have another email client to you, 
   but the contents of the email will still need to display the same. Security features such as data encryption (like HTTPS when visiting a secure site) 
   occur at this layer.

 ->Application Layer:
   The application layer is the layer in which protocols and rules are in place to determine how the user should interact with data sent or received. 
   Everyday applications such as email clients, browsers, or file server browsing software such as FileZilla provide a friendly, Graphical User Interface 
   (GUI) for users to interact with data sent or received. Other protocols include DNS (Domain Name System), which is how website addresses are translated 
   into IP addresses.

Packets and Frames:
Packets and frames are small pieces of data that, when forming together, make a larger piece of information or message. However, they are two different 
things in the OSI model. A packet is a piece of data from Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model, containing information such as an IP header and payload. 
A frame, however, is used at Layer 2 (Data Link) of the OSI model, which, encapsulates the packet and adds additional information such as MAC addresses. 
You can think of this process as similar to mailing a letter through the post. The envelope is a frame, which, is used to move the contents (in this analogy, 
the packet) of the envelope to another place. Once the recepient opens the envelop (frame), they will know how to forward the letter (packet) itself. 
This process is called encapsulation. At this stage, it's safe to assume that when we are talking about anything IP addresses, we are talking about packets. 
When the encapsulating information is stripped away, we're talking about the frame itself. Packets are an efficient way of communicating data across networked 
devices. Because this data is exchanged in small pieces, there is less chance of bottlenecking occurring across a network than large messages being sent at once.
