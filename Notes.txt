Networking:
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices so they can communicate, share resources, and exchange data.
In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your 
laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!

Internet:
The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself. These small networks are called 
private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks or the Internet. The first iteration 
of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence 
Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know 
it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It wasn't until this point that the Internet 
started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.

 IP Address:
 An IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, 
 where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing. An IP address is a set of 
 numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the 
 network. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting, IP addresses can change from device 
 to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network. IP Addresses follow a set of standards 
 known as protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and force many devices to communicate in the same language.
 Depending on where they are will determine what type of IP address they have: a public or private IP address.
 A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst 
 other devices.
